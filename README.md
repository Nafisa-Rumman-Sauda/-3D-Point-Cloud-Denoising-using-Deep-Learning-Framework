# -3D-Point-Cloud-Denoising-using-Deep-Learning-Framework
In this research, I developed a 3D Point Cloud denoising Framework based on deep learning that integrates Normalizing Flows and noise disentanglement techniques to achieve high denoising accuracy. The datasets I used were PUSet, a subset derived from PUNet, and DMRSet, which gathers meshes from ModelNet40.
